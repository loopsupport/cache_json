# Cache JSON

This gem lets you easily cache the results of any computation to Redis. The cache is automatically populated when the `results` method is called.

The cache expires after a specified time, unless you explicitly clear it before that. You can use the provided Sidekiq job to periodically refresh the cache.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cache_json'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cache_json

## Usage

All you need is a class with a `compute_results` method (make sure you use keyword arguments):

```ruby
class ExpensiveJob

  include CacheJSON::Base

  cache_json_options(
    time_to_expire: 1.hour, # Specify how long the cache lives
  )

  def compute_results(first_arg:, second_arg:)
    # Compute some stuff and return the results
    # The results will then be cached *for those specific arguments*
  end
end

# If the cache exists, return it. Otherwise, populate it and return it
ExpensiveJob.new.results(first_arg: "foo", second_arg: "bar")

# Clear the cache for all arguments
ExpensiveJob.new.clear_cache!
```

If you'd like to specify some global defaults, you can put them in `config/initializers/cache_json.rb`

```ruby
CacheJSON.configure do |config|
  config.time_to_expire = 6.hours
end
```

## Automatic refreshing (Sidekiq)

There is a simple Sidekiq job that lets you pre-compute selected classes with specified ranges of arguments. All you have to do is add a `refresh` option:

```ruby
class ExpensiveJob

  include CacheJSON::Base


  cache_json_options(
    time_to_expire: 1.hour,
    refresh: {
      buffer: 5.minutes,
      arguments: {
        first: (5..10),
        second: ['one option', 'another option'],
        third: 'the only option',
        fourth: -> { ['proc result'] }
      }
    }
  )
  ...
end
```

The Sidekiq job will take the Cartesian product of all the argument ranges/arrays (all the combinations).

We leave it to you to schedule the job. If you're using https://github.com/moove-it/sidekiq-scheduler, you can do something like this:

```yml
cache_json_worker:
  every: "20s"
  class: CacheJSON::Worker
```

Whenever the worker runs, it checks which results have expired, and refreshes only those. If you pass in the `buffer` option, it will actually refresh keys that are that far away from expiring. In the example above, the worker will refresh the cache 5 minutes before it expires. This is good if you want to avoid cache misses altogether.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
